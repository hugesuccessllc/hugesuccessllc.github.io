# [GET TICKETS HERE!](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/2f535ac3-91ad-414e-9c75-f32a837a119d)

Join Tod and Claire of the internationally tolerated podcast, [Podsothoth: A Lovecraft Book Club](https://podsothoth.club)
for their live, interactive performance of â€œFungi from Yuggoth!" Originally written by Providence's own HP Lovecraft in
1929 and 1930, this interactive experience at the Black Box Theater will feature dramatic readings of Lovecraftian poetry,
insightful revelations, silly jokes, and more. Audience participation is encouraged, but of course, not required.

Tickets are free for [NecronomiCon Providence](https://necronomicon-providence.com) attendees (and you should get yours today).
But, if you're some kind of weirdo who wants to see this live performance of a Lovecraft podcast *without* committing
to an entire weekend-long conference ticket, we're [asking $10](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/2f535ac3-91ad-414e-9c75-f32a837a119d),
so snag your place in Black Box Theater either way, today!

# BONUS CONTENT!

*The rule of human law means nothing amidst the spewing endless cosmos.*

*But human law can still totally screw up your life, which also means nothing.*

If you haven't had enough of Claire and Tod by the end of the show, never fear, for we will be joined by
friend of the show Harley Geiger, Cyber Lawyer, for a riveting analysis of Lovecraftian Law in their talk,
**Vanitas Horendum Lex: From Beyond the Bar**, hosted by [The Armitage Symposium](https://necronomicon-providence.com/the-armitage-symposium/)
on **Friday, August 16, 2024** at 9:15am at the Omni Hotel, Bristol/Kent Room, 3rd floor.

Come prepared with your legal questions such as,
"If an immortal sorcerer possesses my weird wife, is that sufficient grounds for divorce in Massachusetts in 1924?"
Even better, email us [hideous@podsothoth.club](mailto:hideous@podsothoth.club), and we'll see about incorporating your
fictional legal conundruum into the lecture, time permitting.

This presentation is, of course, only available to NecronomiCon pass holders, but you're in town
anyway, so you may as well, right?

You know we have a [podcast about Lovecraft silliness](https://podsothoth.club), right?

Welp, we have an album now. Maybe the embed below will work. Let's find out together!

You can stream it for free a million times if you want, or you can download it for one buck a track, or $6.66 for the whole thing.

I think it's funny and weirdly infectious, anyway.

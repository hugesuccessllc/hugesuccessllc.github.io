You know we have a [podcast about Lovecraft silliness](https://podsothoth.club), right?

Welp, we have an album now to go along with it. My depravity knows no bounds.

You can stream it for free a million times if you want, or you can download it for one buck a track, or $6.66 for the whole thing. It's got a pretty permissive license, and the lyrics are all public domain, so you're free to go mix your own if you want. Computers are pretty amazing these days, especially when they're not bound by the laws of men and nature.

I think it's funny and weirdly infectious, anyway.

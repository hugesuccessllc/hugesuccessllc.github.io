Hello, world! This is the scaffolding for the new **Huge Success** website. It's quite exciting. I've been using Jekyll for years but kind of never really paid attention to how to use it correctly. I've gotten frustrated enough with my ignorance to figure it out now!

In the meantime, you might be looking for other things I work on, under the auspices of
**Huge Success**, which is likely what brought you here in the first place. Until I get something fancier together, you can probably find that thing, below:

* [Casa Tranquila](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/40339239), in beautiful and remote Terlingua, Texas.
* [Podsothoth: A Lovecraft Book Club](https://podsothoth.club), a horror podcast. Not for everyone.
* [Hot for Teacher: The Greatest American Hero Watch Party](https://hotforteacher.tv), a non-horror podcast.
* [AHA!](https://takeonme.org), where I run the AHA! CVE Numbering Authority.
* [The CVE Program](https://cve.org), where I'm on the board.

Maybe I'll use this site for blogging or something. I usually just post directly on
[Infosec.Exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@todb), but maybe I'll just start porting
posts from here to there.
